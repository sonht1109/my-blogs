## Hi there,
I'm Son. You can call me Shawn. I'm from Vietnam and I was 23 years old at the time I built this blog. I'm working as both FE and BE developer.

This is only some knowledge (actually tips) about software development from varied sources. If I know something, you will know that thing.

Hope these posts will be helpful to you.

Thanks for reading.

P/S: if you have interest in how I built this blog, I will post a short post about it as soon as possible.
