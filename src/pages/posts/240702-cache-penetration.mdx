Cache is one of the most important part when building highly available application. It provides a high-performance way to get frequently accessed data and reduce traffic to our database.

Cache penetration is one of very first problem we should consider when utilizing cache in our application.

## What is cache penetration?

This is a scenario where data to be searched doesn't exist in our database and those empty data is not **cached** as well, so **database always gets hit on every search on same resource** and even cause it to crash.

## Example

This is one simple way we often cache in our application.
<PhotoView src={images[0]}><img src={images[0]} alt="new way to use css variable" /></PhotoView>

Whenever request comes, we will search in cache first. If existed, we return data. Otherwise, we will find in our database, and then **cache** it and return data. So every following request on the same resource will hit cache instead of our database.

But let's imagine that when data is not found in cache, and data is not found in database as well.
<PhotoView src={images[1]}><img src={images[1]} alt="new way to use css variable" /></PhotoView>
Since the queried data is empty, we may think that "Well no data? Nothing to cache" and we just simply return data to client, then every following request on the same resource will hit our database and yep, that's the problem we have mentioned above.

## Solution

Easiest solution here is we will cache those **empty data** as well. Remember to set ttl properly.
<PhotoView src={images[2]}><img src={images[2]} alt="new way to use css variable" /></PhotoView>

## Conclusion
This problem seems simple but we often don't care about it in real cases. Be aware of cache problems will help us to build a better application. So hope this post will help.
