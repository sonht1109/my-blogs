`setTimeout` is used for executing some logic after a certain time. But exactly how long do we have to wait for that logic to be executed?

## How does JS engine execute our code?
JS engine executes code in __single thread__ (main thread). It has something called __Call stack__.
Code will be executed in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) order in which it is called. It means that, if some logic is being executed, other logic will have to wait.
```javascript
console.log(1);
console.log(2);
console.log(3);
// Output
1
2
3
```
Some logic that can take a long time to execute like I/O, network, ... will be executed in other threads to prevent blocking main thread.
They're __asynchronous__ tasks.

## What is Event loop?
We must hear about __Event loop__. __Event loop__ is the secret mechanism behind how JS code is executed. Image below describes how __Event loop__ works in __browser__.
<FYI type="warning">
  <FYI.Container>
    <p>__Event loop__ in browser is different from one in NodeJS. We will mention __Event loop__ in browser in example below.</p>
  </FYI.Container>
</FYI>
<PhotoView src={images[0]}><img src={images[0]} alt="perhaps you missunderstood settimeout" /></PhotoView>

Basically, when a task is executed, it will be pushed into __Call stack__.
If it is __synchronous__ task, it will be executed immediately and popped out of stack.
If it is __asynchronous__ task like `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, `fetch`, ... it will be assigned to browser and browser will pick other threads to execute it.
<FYI type="warning">
  <FYI.Container>
    <p>Functions like `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, `fetch`, ... are not available in JS Engine. They are a part of JS runtime APIs.</p>
  </FYI.Container>
</FYI>
After being executed, its callback will be pushed into __Task queue__. This is when __Event loop__ does its job.
Whenever __Call stack__ is empty, it will pick the first task in __Task queue__ into __Call stack__ to execute.

__Event loop__ is infinite loop which monitors the __Call stack__ and __Task queue__.

## The moment of the truth
As we know above, __a queued task is only picked and executed only when the __Call stack__ is empty__.
So, if we call a `setTimeout` function
```javascript
setTimeout(cb, 100)
```
After 100ms, `cb` will be pushed into __Task queue__ and ready to execute in __Call stack__.
But if __Call stack__ is handling task `A` which takes about 1 min, `cb` will have to wait for 1 min as well.

## Conclusion
Hope this post help you gain a deeper insight about `setTimeout`.
