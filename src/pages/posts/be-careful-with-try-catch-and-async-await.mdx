Sometimes try/catch and async/await may not work as we expect. Let take an example
```js filename="index.js" showLineNumbers copy
const promise = async () => {
  try {
    return Promise.reject("Error message");
  } catch (e) {
    console.log({ "Error catched in promise": e });
  }
};

(async () => {
  try {
    await promise();
  } catch (e) {
    console.log({ "Error catched in main": e });
  }
})();
```
We have a `promise` which is rejected. The error will be catched, but let's try to guess which line will catch the error.

Run file with command below
```bash copy
node index.js
```
you will see that the error is catched `in main`
```bash
{ 'Error catched in main': 'Error message' }
```

But let's change a little bit. We will add `await` in `promise` function
```js showLineNumbers filename="index.js" /await/1 {3}
const promise = async () => {
  try {
    return await Promise.reject("Error message");
  } catch (e) {
    console.log({ "Error catched in promise": e });
  }
};
```

Run the file again and see the result
```bash
{ 'Error catched in promise': 'Error message' }
```

That's it. The result has changed.
In real world, this case can lead to some unexpected results so just be aware all of your code lines.
