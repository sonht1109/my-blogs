Today we will learn how to use `useContext` with `useReducer` to replace Redux.

Of course, this technique cannot replace totally Redux, but it will be super helpful for small applications where Redux can be complex and unneccessary.

## Why do we combine `useContext` and `useReducer`?
As I mention above, maybe you will face some cases where Redux is redundant and __overkill__. We just need a more simple way to manage states and avoid prop drilling.
`useContext` is perfect hook for those cases. But it's will be much more amazing if we use with `useReducer`. `useReducer` is useful for complex state transititions.

Let's get started. We will create a `counter` app.

### 1. Create context
```jsx filename="context.jsx" showLineNumbers copy
import React from "react";
const CounterContext = React.createContext();
```

### 2. Define actions
```js filename="actions.js" showLineNumbers copy
export const ACTION_TYPE = {
  INCREASE = 'increase',
  DECREASE = 'decrease'
}

const actions = {
  increase: (payload) => ({type: ACTION_TYPE.INCREASE, payload}),
  decrease: (payload) => ({type: ACTION_TYPE.DECREASE, payload}),
}

export default actions
```

### 3. Define reducer function
```js filename="context.js" showLineNumbers copy
import {ACTION_TYPE} from './action.js'

export const counterReducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case ACTION_TYPE.INCREASE:
      return {...state, value: state.value + action.payload};
    
    case ACTION_TYPE.DECREASE:
      return {...state, value: state.value - action.payload};

    default:
      return state
  }
}
```

### 4. Define context provider
Continue in file `context.jsx`. We will create a provider and use `useReducer` here.
```jsx showLineNumbers /useReducer/ filename="context.jsx" copy
const initState = {
  value: 1
}

export const ContextProvider = ({children}) => {
  const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(counterReducer, initState);

  return (
    <CounterContext.Provider value={{counter: state.value, dispatch}}>
      {children}
    </ContextProvider.Provider>
  )
}
```

### 5. Wrap components with provider
```jsx filename="app.jsx" showLineNumbers copy
import React from 'react';
import {CounterProvider} from './context.jsx'
import Counter from './Counter.jsx'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <CounterProvider>
      <Counter />
    </CounterProvider>
  )
}
```

### 6. Consume context in child component
```jsx showLineNumbers /useContext/ filename="Counter.jsx" copy
import React from 'react'
import {CounterContext} from './context.jsx'
import actions from './actions.js'

export default function Counter() {
  const {counter, dispatch} = React.useContext(CounterContext)

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Counter: {counter}</p>
      <div>
        <button onClick={() => dispatch(actions.increase(1))}>Increase by 1</button>
        <button onClick={() => dispatch(actions.decrease(1))}>Decrease by 1</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Note
You should be careful with app performance at this line `<CounterContext.Provider value={{counter: state.value, dispatch}}>`. But why?

Everytime `Counter.Provider` rerenders (by another state or something like that), it will create a new `value` object. It means that context changes and it will lead to rerender every child component subscribing that context.

To solve this issue, we can use `useMemo`.

```jsx showLineNumbers copy
const value = React.useMemo(() => ({counter: state.value, dispatch}), [state, dispatch]);

// and apply to provider
<CounterContext.Provider value={value}>
```

Another way is to seperate context like this, which is much more complicated.

```jsx showLineNumbers copy
const StateContext = React.createContext();
const DispatchContext = React.createContext();

// and apply to provider
const CounterProvider = () => {
  return (
    <DispatchContext.Provider value={dispatch}>
      <StateContext.Provider value={state.value}>
        <App />
      </StateContext.Provider>
    </DispatchContext.Provider>
  )
}
```

## Conclusion
Consider to use this technique to replace Redux regarding your cases since Redux still has its advantages to handle complex cases. And use `useReducer` is not always neccessary.
